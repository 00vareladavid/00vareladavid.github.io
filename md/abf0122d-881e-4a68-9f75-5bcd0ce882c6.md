# dlog: the engine behind this blog

`dlog` is a simple blog engine that integrates well with other linux tools.

## goals

- creating content should be no more complex than editing a markdown file
- integrates well with tools following the UNIX philosophy
- light payload
- minimal, but complete API
- a focus on the readablility of the end product

## api
- `new`/`remove`: register or remove a post from dlog's database
- `live_demo`: serve the a debuggable version of the site locally
- `live_prod`: serve the end product locally
- `publish`/`unpublish`: mark/unmark posts to be included in the production payload
- `edit`: edit the markdown version of a post (with a text editor of the user's choice)
- `print`: print out a line-oriented representation of dlog's database

## other features

- view logging output of internal commands (eg with `less +F`)
- live, local view of site
- skeleton.css is used as a base, easy to configure from that point

## example workflow
Edit markdown files while checking local mirror as a reference.
When things look good, push to github.
That's it!
